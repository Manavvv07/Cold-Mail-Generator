# Windows Development Environment Fixes

## Environment Analysis
- OS: Microsoft Windows 11 Home Single Language 10.0.22631
- Python: 3.12.2
- Node.js: v24.7.0 (LTS compatible)
- npm: 11.5.1

## Project Structure
- Full-stack app: FastAPI backend + React/TypeScript frontend
- Backend: Python with FastAPI, uvicorn, Playwright, LangChain, Groq
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS
- AI Features: Job scraping and email generation

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Outdated AI Model References
- FIXED: Updated deprecated Groq model names from `llama3-70b-8192` and `llama3-8b-8192` to `llama-3.1-8b-instant`
- Both backend services (email generation and job scraping) now use supported models

### 2. Backend Error Handling
- FIXED: Updated error handlers in main.py to return proper JSON responses using JSONResponse
- Added missing import for JSONResponse from fastapi.responses

### 3. Package.json Scripts
- FIXED: Updated root package.json scripts to use proper Python commands instead of Node.js for backend
- Added proper start scripts for both backend and frontend
- Updated install:all script to include Playwright browser installation

### 4. Cross-platform Compatibility
- FIXED: All scripts now work on Windows without requiring Unix-specific commands
- No need for cross-env as we're using Windows-compatible commands

### 5. Component Integration
- VERIFIED: All backend components (email service, job scraper) are working correctly
- VERIFIED: Frontend builds successfully without errors
- VERIFIED: CORS is properly configured for frontend-backend communication

## Current Status
✅ All components are working correctly
✅ Backend server starts without errors
✅ Frontend builds successfully
✅ AI services are functional with updated models
✅ Cross-platform compatibility achieved

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start both the backend (on port 8000) and frontend (on port 5173) concurrently.

### Production Mode
1. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run build
   ```

2. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend && python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

### Environment Variables
Make sure to set up the required environment variables:
- Backend: Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with your `GROQ_API_KEY`
- Frontend: Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory with `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`
